<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! Im Pranav Dharmarajan, a passionate tech enthusiast and problem solver with a love for building efficient, user-focused solutions. 
   I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving complex challenges, and finding creative ways to make ideas come to life. 
   Whether it's developing web applications, optimizing cloud infrastructure, or experimenting with AI models, 
   I'm always eager to learn and push my boundaries.</p>

<p>My journey in technology started with curiosity and has grown into a career fueled by continuous learning. 
   Over the years, I've worked on projects ranging from AI-driven fraud detection systems to cloud-based deployment pipelines, 
   blending technical expertise with a focus on performance and usability. I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas are shared openly, 
   and problem-solving is a team sport.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I'm a firm believer in personal growth and balance. I love going to the gym, traveling to explore different cultures, 
   and trying out new experiences that push me out of my comfort zone. Every project I take on is a chance to learn something new, 
   meet inspiring people, and make a meaningful impact.</p>
